# Web Buddy Local Web Agent Runtime

`@multi-functional-agent/web-buddy` is the main package for the local,
auditable Web Agent runtime. It owns the Playwright browser tools, local agent
loop, MCP server, CLI, Web UI, observation model, context assembly, policy
boundary, session store, trace, metrics, benchmarks, and safety report helpers.

Job application is the flagship workflow, but the runtime is broader than
recruiting automation. The default demos use local fixtures so a new user can
verify browser control, observation artifacts, metrics, and safety reports
without a real account, captcha, or live website.

## Safety Contract

The runtime does not automatically log in, solve captchas, bypass human
verification, upload files, save drafts, or final-submit real forms. Sensitive
steps route through human gates. `PolicyEngine` classifies risk before tools
execute; `PermissionEngine` maps policy to allow/ask/deny according to
`PERMISSION_MODE`; `HumanGate` confirms or hands off sensitive steps.
Trace, metrics, and `safety-report.json` are diagnostic artifacts, not runtime
state sources.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run build

# Local mock form fill. No key, login, or network.
npm run demo:form

# Local read-only web research. No key, login, or network.
npm run demo:research

# Web console. Select the Venue scenario for a non-resume, multi-step test.
npm run web

# Generate safety-report.json for the latest trace.
npm run report:safety

# Maintainer regression entry.
npm run test:mvp
```

## Demo Positioning

| Entry | What it proves | Safety profile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run demo:form` | Local form observation, resume-based filling, submit-adjacent gate behavior. | Offline fixture; never contacts a real site. |
| `npm run demo:research` | Read-only page observation, structured summary artifact, trace, metrics, safety report. | Offline fixture; no login, no form submit, no L3/L4 action. |
| Web console → `Venue` | Compare five venues, choose the only fully compliant option, fill a booking draft, and stop before payment. | Local fixture; uses fake contact data and must leave the payment boundary untouched. |
| `npm run demo:match` | Read-only Alibaba multi-page list/detail matching for the flagship workflow. | Threshold-gated; does not final-submit. |
| `npm run alibaba:apply` | Complex flagship workflow through the optional Claude Code adapter. | Requires model and human handoff for login/captcha/final submit. |

## Resume and Matching v2

Resume inputs for CLI/Web UI are `.pdf`, `.json`, and `.txt`. The v2 SDK
parser (`readResumeV2` / `ingestResume`) returns `resume-profile/v2` with
field-level confidence, short sanitized evidence, schema validation, optional
LLM parsing, heuristic fallback, and deterministic email/phone repair. The
current orchestrator still consumes the compatible `ResumeProfile` shape, so
operator-facing runs use the same `--resume` flag while tests and SDK callers
can inspect v2 output directly.

```bash
npm run test:resume
npm run test:resume-ingest
npm run fill -- https://your-recruiting-site.example/apply --resume /path/to/resume.pdf
```

Text PDFs are extracted with `pdfjs-dist`. Scanned or image-heavy PDFs are
best-effort and produce warnings; do not assume PDF parsing is perfect.

Alibaba/list-style matching now separates fast list crawl from detail
enrichment:

```bash
npm run demo:match -- \
  --resume /path/to/resume.pdf \
  --max-pages 5 \
  --max-crawl-jobs 100 \
  --max-jobs 10 \
  --match-threshold 0.45
```

The defaults are 5 pages, up to 100 unique list candidates, Top 10 detail pages,
and a final match threshold of `0.45`. Low matches stop before the apply flow.

## Run Observability

Each local Web Agent run writes an append-only session plus a unified trace
identity. Session files are the runtime recovery source; trace files remain
diagnostic review artifacts. `npm run report:safety` adds `safety-report.json`
for the selected run. Mode-specific artifacts appear when that workflow
produces them:

```text
output/sessions/<sessionId>/session.json
output/sessions/<sessionId>/transcript.jsonl
output/sessions/<sessionId>/events.jsonl
output/sessions/<sessionId>/workflow.json
output/<runId>/trace.jsonl
output/<runId>/summary.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/run-manifest.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/metrics.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/agent-state.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/safety-report.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/page-state-latest.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/form-state-latest.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/research-summary.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/risk-decisions.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/job-candidates-coarse.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/job-candidates-final.json
output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/direct-submit-review.json
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run report:safety
npm run report:safety -- --run-id <runId>
npm run report:safety -- --trace-dir ../../output/traces/<sessionId>
npm run benchmark:research
npm run test:resume-ingest
npm run test:job-crawl-pagination
npm run test:job-match-threshold
npm run test:permission-modes
npm run test:direct-submit-flow
npm run test:risk-timeline
npm run test:tool-execution
npm run test:kernel
npm run test:session
```

The research benchmark validates `metrics.json`, `page-state-latest.json`,
`research-summary.json`, and `safety-report.json`.

## Runtime Memory And Resume

Web Buddy keeps run recovery and user memory separate:

- `output/sessions/<sessionId>/transcript.jsonl` is the append-only run fact
  source. `restoreSessionState()` rebuilds workflow facts and `restoredMessages`
  from this transcript so resume flows can inspect both state and message
  causality.
- `~/.web-buddy/memory/answers.json` stores user answers collected through
  `ask_user`, such as stable application preferences.
- `~/.web-buddy/memory/permission-rules.json` stores remembered permission rules
  that are matched before default permission rules.

Override memory paths when running tests or isolated profiles:

```bash
WEB_BUDDY_MEMORY_DIR=/tmp/web-buddy-memory npm run fill -- https://example.com/apply
WEB_BUDDY_ANSWER_STORE_PATH=/tmp/answers.json npm run demo:form
WEB_BUDDY_PERMISSION_RULES_PATH=/tmp/permission-rules.json npm run demo:form
```

The default token budget guard is also enabled without explicit configuration.
Token budget events in `events.jsonl` show the current estimate, threshold, and
whether the default max input window is being used.

## Artifacts

Primary run review artifacts live under `output/traces/<sessionId>/artifacts/`.
Some Plan 2 artifacts are also copied to `output/<runId>/` for legacy scripts.

- `page-state-latest.json` and `form-state-latest.json`: latest observed page
  and form state for review.
- `research-summary.json`: structured output from the read-only research demo.
- `job-candidates-coarse.json`: all crawled list candidates after fast scoring.
- `job-candidates-final.json`: detail-enriched and optionally LLM-reranked
  shortlist plus the threshold decision.
- `risk-decisions.json`: compact policy/permission outcomes with counts for
  allowed, auto-allowed, gated, and denied actions.
- `direct-submit-review.json`: explanation and signals when a recruiting site
  has no fillable form and the next step would be final submit.
- `safety-report.json`: generated report summarizing final-submit, login,
  captcha, and high-risk outcomes.

Artifacts are for debugging and audit. They may include screenshots, URLs, and
resume-derived summaries, so keep `output/` out of commits.

## Phase 2 Kernel Notes

Phase 2 is splitting the local runtime in small compatibility-preserving steps.
Plan 2 wrapped the runtime entry in Kernel control:

```text
AgentRuntime.run()
  -> AgentKernel.start()
    -> QueryLoop.run()
      -> runAgentLoop()
```

Plan 3 moves single-tool execution out of `runAgentLoop` without making
`QueryLoop` own tool scheduling yet:

```text
QueryLoop
  -> runAgentLoop
    -> ToolExecutionService
```

`ToolExecutionService v1` is an execution layer for one already-approved tool
call. It owns tool use context, execution state, timeout, abort-before-execution,
and error normalization. It preserves normal successful observations and
existing `FAILED (...)` observations so the model-visible behavior stays
compatible.

Boundaries:

- `PolicyEngine` decides risk and allow / gate / block / auto-confirm before
  tools execute.
- `HumanGate` keeps user confirmation and handoff behavior.
- The future `PermissionEngine` will own general permission rules and approval
  queues; it is not part of ToolExecutionService v1.
- Workflow state and future evidence checks remain outside the execution
  service.

Phase 2C v1 does not claim full pause/resume, automatic retry, concurrent tool
execution, streaming tool output, or forced cancellation of an already-running
Playwright action.

Plan 3 adds the dedicated service-level verification command
`npm run test:tool-execution-service`; keep `npm run test:tool-execution`,
`npm run test:agent-loop`, `npm run test:kernel`, `npm run test:session`, and
`npm run test:mvp` as compatibility checks around it.

Plan 4 / Phase 2D is the permission boundary step after ToolExecutionService:

```text
runAgentLoop
  -> PolicyEngine
  -> PermissionEngine
  -> ApprovalQueue if ask
  -> HumanGate if ask
  -> ToolExecutionService
```

The split is intentionally narrow:

- `PolicyEngine` remains the risk and policy recommendation layer
  (`allow` / `gate` / `block` / `auto_confirm`).
- `PermissionEngine` maps the policy recommendation and runtime context to
  `allow` / `ask` / `deny`.
- `ApprovalQueue v1` records in-memory pending/resolved approvals for the
  current process; it does not decide risk, persist permissions, or replace UI.
- `HumanGate` still performs the actual user prompt or handoff.

Phase 2D v1 does not claim a complete Task Cockpit approval UI, persistent
permission store, cross-process approval recovery, or "always allow" rules.
When implemented, it should add `npm run test:permission` and either
`npm run test:approval-queue` or include approval queue coverage inside
`test:permission`.

## CLI

After `npm run build`:

```bash
node dist/cli/demo.js <command> [options]
```

| Command | What it does | Needs key? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `demo-form` | Local mock form; agent loop or heuristic fallback fills a draft and stops before submit. | No |
| `demo-research` | Local read-only product/docs page; captures observation and structured research summary. | No |
| `raw <url>` | LLM drives the browser directly from your prompt and resume. | Yes |
| `fill <url>` | Cookie-login target site, then LLM-driven form filling from resume. Never final-submits. | Yes |
| `login <url>` | Open a visible browser for manual login and save Playwright storage state. | No |
| `match [--list-url]` | Alibaba list/detail scraping and resume matching, read-only. | Optional |
| `auto-apply <url>` | Structured local/sandbox job board benchmark flow. | No for local fixtures |
| `alibaba-apply [url]` | Local raw Alibaba run used by `npm run alibaba:apply:raw`. | Yes |

Options include `--resume`, `--headful`, `--headless`, `--auto-gate`,
`--model-key`, `--base-url`, `--model-name`, `--storage-state`, `--prompt`,
`--keep-browser-open`, `--profile`, `--permission-mode`, `--max-jobs`,
`--max-pages`, `--max-crawl-jobs`, and `--match-threshold`.

Permission modes can also be set with `PERMISSION_MODE=safe|review|trusted|autopilot`.
They affect PermissionEngine decisions for local runtime tool calls. Login,
captcha, upload, save-resume, and `final_submit` remain sensitive gates by
default; `HUMAN_GATE_MODE=auto` is a non-interactive handoff mode, not final
submit authorization.

## Web UI

```bash
npm run web
```

Open `http://localhost:5178` to configure a model, upload a resume, run demos or
fill workflows, and inspect live events, screenshots, trace steps, and metrics.

From the repository root, the same UI and headless local checks can run inside
Docker:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up agent
docker compose run --rm agent npm --prefix packages/web-buddy run test:e2e-auto-apply
docker compose run --rm agent node packages/web-buddy/dist/cli/demo.js demo-form --headless --auto-gate
```

## Architecture

```text

  runtime/local/           self-owned local Web Agent loop and ToolRegistry
  tools/                   shared Tool Catalog plus local/MCP adapters
  browser/                 Playwright browser tool handlers

  observation/             PageState, FormState, ObservationManager
  context/                 ContextManager, prompt sections, budget metrics
  agent/                   AgentRuntime facade, PromptAssembler, stop conditions
  session/                 FileSessionStore, transcript, KernelEvent recorder
  kernel/                  AgentKernel, QueryLoop, RunController, turn snapshots
  policy/                  PolicyEngine, audit event, safety report helper
  workflow/                WorkflowState and transition helpers
  sdk/                     orchestrator, config, llm, trace, human gate, resume
  web/                     HTTP/SSE server and dashboard
  cli/                     demo CLI
```

The local runtime and MCP server share tool definitions through
`src/tools/catalog.ts`. Execution paths stay separate: local runtime tools still
call existing browser handlers, and MCP clients call the MCP adapter.

Observation is runtime memory first and artifact second. `browser_snapshot` and
`browser_form_snapshot` refresh PageState/FormState for context and write
latest artifacts best-effort for trace, benchmarks, and review.

## Generic Fill

The runtime does not hardcode site-specific field mappings. It snapshots the
current page into a compact view such as:

```text
[e1] input "Name" risk=L2
[e4] button "Submit application" risk=L3
```

The model receives the page view, selected context, resume profile, and browser
tools. It chooses tool calls, the runtime applies policy before execution, and
the loop repeats until the draft is filled, blocked, or handed off.

## MCP Server

The same browser capabilities are exposed over MCP stdio from `dist/server.js`:
`browser_open`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`,
`browser_select`, `browser_wait`, `browser_screenshot`,
`browser_form_snapshot`, `browser_click_text`, `browser_fill_by_label`,
`browser_select_by_text`, and `browser_upload_file`.

See [../../configs/mcp.playwright.example.json](../../configs/mcp.playwright.example.json).

```

## Model Configuration

`fill`, `raw`, and Alibaba apply paths need a model that supports tool calling.
Copy the example env file from the repository root:

```bash
cp ../../configs/agent.env.example ../../.env
```

Supported wire formats:

- Anthropic-compatible via `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`.
- OpenAI-compatible via `MODEL_API_KEY`, `MODEL_BASE_URL`, and `MODEL_NAME`.
- Alibaba Cloud Model Studio / Bailian Qwen via `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`,
  `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`, and `DASHSCOPE_MODEL`.

Qwen example:

```env
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_api_key
DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
DASHSCOPE_MODEL=qwen-plus
MODEL_ENABLE_THINKING=false
```

For workspace endpoints, use:

```env
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL=https://<workspace-id>.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
```

Check model connectivity and function calling:

```bash
npm run test:model
```

Do not commit `.env`, cookies, storage state, resume content, or verification
codes.

## Troubleshooting

### Resume fields look wrong or low-confidence

Run `npm run test:resume-ingest` to verify the local parser path. For real
files, prefer text PDFs, JSON, or TXT. Scanned PDFs may produce sparse text and
warnings; review the generated profile before using it for a real workflow.

### Matching stops at `no_match`

Open `job-candidates-final.json` and check the threshold decision. You can tune
`--match-threshold`, `--max-pages`, `--max-crawl-jobs`, or `--max-jobs`, but do
not lower the threshold just to force an unrelated job into the apply flow.

### Direct-submit review appears

This is expected on sites that use online resumes and show only an agreement
checkbox plus a final apply button. Review `direct-submit-review.json`; the
runtime stopped before `final_submit`.

### Permission mode still asks

That is usually correct. Permission modes auto-allow only eligible non-final
actions. Login, captcha, upload, save-resume, and final submit remain gated by
default.

### Model smoke test fails with provider/account errors

`npm run test:model` depends on the configured provider account. HTTP 400/401,
quota, or billing errors are external availability issues; local no-key
fixtures can still pass.

### Browser stays open in CI or no-TTY runs

If `--keep-browser-open` or `PLAYWRIGHT_KEEP_BROWSER_OPEN=true` is set without
a TTY, the process intentionally remains alive so the final page can be
inspected. Stop the process or unset the flag.

### Live site behavior differs from fixtures

Recruiting site DOM and login flows change. Start headful, keep final-submit
gated, inspect screenshots and trace artifacts, and complete login/captcha only
manually. The runtime does not claim it can bypass those checks.
